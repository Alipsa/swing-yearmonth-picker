A year-month date picker component for java swing. Requires java 11 or higher (tested with jdk 11 and 17)

There are two versions:
1. YearMonthPickerCombo - a combobox that return a YearMonth.
2. YearMonthPicker - A custom control that resembles DatePicker where the user can click a calendar and then pick the
   desired year month.

Both works similar to a combo box i.e. you do getValue() to get the value and
setOnAction() to capture a value change e.g.
```java
import se.alipsa.symp.YearMonthPicker;

class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame frame = new JFrame("Year month combo");
    JPanel panel = new JPanel();
    frame.add(panel);
    YearMonthPicker ymp = new YearMonthPicker();
    ymp.addListener(e -> System.out.println(ymp.getValue()));
    panel.add(new JLabel("Default Combo: "));
    panel.add(ymp);
    frame.pack();
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    frame.setVisible(true);
  }
}
```

There are no external dependencies, and the jar file is about 40kb so nice and small. You can download the jar file from
the release section or add the following to your maven file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>se.alipsa</groupId>
  <artifactId>swing-yearmonth-picker</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
...or the equivalent to you favorite build tool.
The module name for this library is `se.alipsa.symp`
